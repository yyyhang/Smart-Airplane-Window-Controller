# Smart-Airplane-Window-Controller

This is a simulation system with the AVR Development board (ATmega2560), which simulates the window control operations in an airplane.

For individual control, it can increase or decrease the windowâ€™s opaque level. 

For central control, it can set all windows to clear or set all windows to dark.

It takes one second for a window to change from one state to another for local control and central control.

Push button is used as emergency status and set all windows as clear right away.
